This repo is used for expression evaluation, which can be seen as a sort of extension of the NJU ics lab.
It can calculate nested expressions including complex number and hexdecimal number.
And for convience, complex number in this program has to follow the format of {complex number}, e.g. {1+2i} is allowed and 1+2i is prohibited.
