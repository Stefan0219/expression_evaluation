This repo is used for expression evaluation, which can be seen as a sort of extension of the NJU ics lab.
It can calculate nested expressions including complex number and hexdecimal number.
For convience, complex number in this program has to follow the format of {complex number}, e.g. {1+2i} is allowed but 1+2i is prohibited.
And this project is available if regex.h file exists in your current environment.
