This program is used for expression evaluation, which can be seen as a sort of extension of the NJU ics [lab](https://nju-projectn.github.io/ics-pa-gitbook/ics2021/index.html).
It can calculate nested expressions including complex number and hexdecimal number.
For convience, complex numbers in this program have to obey the format of {complex number}, e.g. {1+2i} is allowed but 1+2i is prohibited.
